✅ Objective:
To build a To-Do List Web Application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks, with data persisted in local storage.

🔧 Tools Used:
HTML – For page structure (index.html)

CSS – For styling and layout (style.css)

JavaScript – For interactivity and localStorage operations (script.js)

Browser localStorage – To save data across sessions

📝 Steps Performed:
HTML Structure:

Input field and button for adding tasks

Unordered list (<ul>) to display tasks

CSS Styling:

Responsive layout with centered input box and styled list items

Buttons for edit and delete actions with hover effects

JavaScript Functionality:

addTodo() adds new task or edits existing one

updateTodo() handles Edit/Delete actions

saveLocalTodos() stores tasks in localStorage

getLocalTodos() loads saved tasks when the page reloads

deleteLocalTodos() removes a task from localStorage

editLocalTodos() updates a task in localStorage

📌 Outcome:
A fully functional, browser-based To-Do List App

Tasks persist even after refreshing the browser

Clean UI with intuitive controls for managing tasks
